<h2>ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF BOGUS FREEMASONRY AMONG COLORED MEN<br />

In the United States of America and Texas, From its Earliest
Introduction</h2>

<hr class="hr3" />

<p class="right">San Antonio, Texas Dec 1, 1908</p>

<p>In order that the members of the Masonic Fraternity may have a correct
and thorough understanding about the origin and the irregularity of
Freemasonry among Colored men in the state of Texas, it will be
<a name="necessary" id="necessary"></a><ins title="Original has 'neccessary'">necessary</ins> to state the time and place that clandestine
and spurious Freemasonry among Colored Men was instituted in the state
of Massachusetts and also the establishing of that self constituted
African Grand Lodge of Modern Masons of Massachusetts which is now the
Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Massachusetts for it was from that corrupt,
notorious, bogus Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Massachusetts whose record
covers the very blackest page in masonic history that Freemasonry among
Colored Men in the state of Texas first originated from. I am fully
aware of the fact that when the truth is told about the actions and
conduct of the leaders of the Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Massachusetts
which has been done from time to time their minds are inflamed to an
extra ordinary degree of madness, hatred and dislike and they talk and
write and say anything except the truth, and the truth they will never
state except it is by accident on one hand and mistake on the other.</p>


<h3>FREEMASONRY AMONG COLORED MEN IN MASSACHUSETTS</h3>

<p class="center">March 6, 1775</p>


<p>1st question. Who were the Colored Men in the state of Massachusetts
that have advertised themselves and who claimed to have been made Master
Masons in a White Masonic Lodge in the state of Massachusetts. Can you
state the time and place and under what circumstances they have asserted
that it <a name="occurred" id="occurred"></a><ins title="Original has 'occurrd'">occurred</ins>?</p>

<p>1st Answer. The Colored Men in the state of Massachusetts that have been
advertised of having been made Master Masons, were Prince Hall, Boston
Smith, Thomas Sanderson and two or three others. They have said and have
tried to make someone believe that they were made Master Masons in a
White Masonic Lodge that was called a Traveling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span> Masonic Lodge and that
it was connected with General Gages Military Regiment at Boston
Massachusetts on the 6th of March 1775 and that this White Masonic Lodge
in General Gages Military Regiment, they said, held a charter from the
Grand Lodge of England, and replying to that unwarranted statement made
and published by the leaders of the spurious Prince Hall Grand Lodge of
Massachusetts, for the Grand Lodge of England has repeatedly said that
they did not have any masonic lodge in General Gages Military Regiment
when that regiment was in the United States and the question has time
after time been asked the members of the Prince Hall Grand Lodge of
Massachusetts and particularly those in Massachusetts that claim to know
so much about it to give the name and the number of that masonic lodge
that Prince Hall, Boston Smith and Thomas Sanderson was made master
masons in that was connected with General Gages Military Regiment which
was then in the United States, and these <a name="wily" id="wily"></a><ins title="Original has 'wiley'">wily</ins> fellows and
Masonic intervators have never been able to give us any information as
to what the name or even the number of this Masonic Lodge that they say
was in General Gages Military Regiment. And inasmuch as no person has
ever been found that could furnish any genuine information about this
matter there is no doubt but the statements that have been paraded
around the country about this matter were bare-faced, willful and
malicious falsehoods, and in the absence of any proof to confirm their
statements it is very safe to say that Prince Hall, Boston Smith, Thomas
Sanderson and their associates simply went to bed at night and dreamed
that they had been made Master Masons and got up next morning with their
minds in a high state of hallucination and really thought it was so,
when as a matter of fact there was nothing, nothing in it, and they
simply drew on their imaginations.</p>

<p>2nd question. What was the name of the first lodge of Colored Men who
belonged to the Masonic fraternity in the state of Mass.?</p>

<p>2nd Answer. The name of the first Colored Lodge of Masons in the state
of Massachusetts was a lodge named African Lodge No. 459.</p>

<p>3rd question. When was the first Grand Lodge of Colored Masons organized
in the state of <a name="Mass" id="Mass"></a><ins title="Original has 'Mass'">Mass.</ins>?</p>

<p>3rd Answer. The name of the first Grand Lodge of Colored Masons that was
organized in the state of Mass. was a Grand Lodge that was designated as
African Grand Lodge of Modern <a name="Masons" id="Masons"></a><ins title="Original has 'Mason'">Masons</ins> of Mass.</p>

<p>4th question. How many lodges took part in the organization of African
Grand Lodge of Modern Masons that was organized at Boston Mass. on the
24th of June 1791?</p>

<p>4th Answer. There was only one lodge that took part in the organization
of African Grand Lodge of Masons of Mass. on the 24th of June<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span> 1791 at
Boston Mass. when the Masonic law and landmarks of Freemasonry have said
that in order to organize a regular Grand Lodge it requires not less
than three warranted lodges, that has been the Masonic law both in this
country and in Europe and has been followed and strictly adhered to by
every well regulated and lawful Masonic Grand Lodge since the year of
1717 down to the present day and not otherwise.</p>

<p>5th question. What is meant by the words F. &amp; A. M.?</p>

<p>5th Answer. Free and Accepted Mason the words and title of Free and
Accepted Mason is an innovation in Masonry and was adopted by Masons who
did not wish to follow the early established custom rules and principles
of the Masonic fraternity.</p>

<p>6th question. What is meant by the words and title A. F. &amp; A. M.?</p>

<p><a name="answer" id="answer"></a><ins title="Original omits paragraph break">6th</ins> Answer. The words A. F. &amp; A. M. means Ancient Free and
Accepted Masons which words and title are of ancient origin and should
be used and adopted by every well regulated Masonic subordinate lodge
and Grand Lodge in this country. For it is in keeping with the early
ancient Masonic laws rules and regulations of the Masonic fraternity.</p>

<p>7th question. What is meant by the words and title of states rights,
masons as you so often hear in the state of Texas by the masons who
belong to the so-called Grand Lodge of Texas that J. W. McKinney is the
Grand Master of and also the so-called Grand Lodge of the State of New
York that one individual who goes by the name of Henry A. Spencer who
advertises himself as being the Grand Master of the so-called Grand
Lodge of Colored Masons of the state of New York which is a self
constituted and bogus grand body?</p>

<p>7th Answer. The best application and definition that can be given to
those masons who call themselves state right masons is that they are no
masons at all. For if a man is a legal and genuine mason he <a name="is" id="is"></a><ins title="Original has 'it'">is</ins> a
mason all over the world, and is to be recognized as a mason in every
land and in every <a name="country1" id="country1"></a><ins title="Original has 'coutry'">country</ins>, but the masons in the state of
Texas that belong to the McKinney Grand Lodge in Texas and the self
constituted Grand Lodge in the state of New York that Henry A. Spencer
is at the head of they are not recognized all over the world and these
being state institutions and the masons who belong in Texas and of New
York are not recognized as legitimate masons in any part of the world.</p>

<p>8th question. What is meant by the numbers of 3, 5 and 7?</p>

<p>8th Answer. The fundamental numbers in Freemasonry are 3, 5 and 7, and
of these, by far the most essential is the number 3. The three principal
columns are Wisdom, Strength and Beauty, and a lodge is supported by
them.</p>

<p>The number "three" derived its significance in the early period of
antiquity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span> and back in the ages of the earliest centuries, no court of
law was legally organized unless three judges were present, and these
tribunals perpetuated ancient temples worshipped frequently, if not
invariably convened, under trees, in imitation of the Scandinavian ash.</p>

<p>Seven threes were prescribed as the highest number. The judges were
absolutely required to open and regularly hold a court of justice. The
maximum was seven, and in some cases five were demanded to proceed in
due form to adjudicate upon the matter brought before them. These
practices in early days present a solution of the Masonic landmark that
three or more members are necessary to open or close a Masonic lodge.</p>

<p>9th question. What is meant by the word and title of A. F. &amp; A. Y.
Masons?</p>

<p>9th Answer. A. F. &amp; A. Y. Masons means Ancient, Free and Accepted York
Masons, the city of York is in the north part of England it is
celebrated for its traditional connection with Freemasonry in England.
The first charter granted in England to the Masons as a body was by
authority and power of King Athelstan, in the year of 926 at York,
England and the application was made by Prince Edwin and Prince Edwin
summoned all the Masons in England to meet him in congregation at the
City of York, England and from this assemblage of Masons at York the
letter "Y"
<a name="originated" id="originated"></a><ins title="Original has comma">originated.</ins> Prince Edwin was elected Grand Master of
the Grand Lodge that was <a name="organized" id="organized"></a><ins title="Original has 'orgrnized'">organized</ins> at York England in 926.
From the commencement of 926 of the assembly of Masons at York the
letter "Y" commenced, and has been known among members of the Masonic
fraternity and at the establishing of the Grand Lodge at York, England
in the year 926 they adopted a constitution and general regulation for
the craft.</p>

<p>Prince Edwin, the brother of King <a name="Athelstan1" id="Athelstan1"></a><ins title="Original has 'Athlestan'">Athelstan</ins> of England was
an <a name="eminent" id="eminent"></a><ins title="Original has 'eniment'">eminent</ins> and distinguished Mason and King
<a name="Athelstan2" id="Athelstan2"></a><ins title="Original has 'Athlestan'">Athelstan</ins> was the grandson of King Alfred the first
<a name="anointed1" id="anointed1"></a><ins title="Original has 'annointed'">anointed</ins> King of England who translated the Holy Bible
into the Saxon language.</p>

<p>The Grand Lodge that was established in York, England in 926 prospered
and flourished. The City of York, England was the seat of Masonic
government of the craft in England.</p>

<hr class="hr3" />

<p>The self styled Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Mass. and the Grand Lodges
among Colored Masons that recognized them and affiliated with them have
time after time published in their printed proceedings to the Masonic
world that Freemasonry among Colored Men in the state of Mass. commenced
at the time when Prince Hall, Boston Smith, Thomas Sanderson and their
associates were made master masons that it was in a white lodge and that
this White Masonic Lodge was connected with General Gages Military
Regiment, and that this Military Regiment was at Boston Mass. March the
6th 1775 and the Masonic Lodge that was claimed to be connected with
General Gages Military Regiment holds its charter of power and authority
from the Grand Lodge of England and they positively state in language
that it is so plain that it cannot be misunderstood that Prince Hall,
Boston Smith, Thomas Sanderson and their followers was made Master
Masons on the 6th of March 1775 at Boston Mass. if any person has any
doubt about the matter read the printed Masonic proceedings of the
Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Mass. of 1875, 1876 and 1877 and the year of
1903 and 1904. See the History of Freemasonry among Colored Men in the
State of Mass. by the late Louis Hayden past Grand Master of the Prince
Hall Grand Lodge of Mass. See the Grand Lodge proceedings of Illinois
for the year of 1873, 1874 and 1875. See the Grand Lodge proceedings of
Pennsylvania of 1865, 1872, and 1876. See the historical facts of
Freemasonry among Colored Men in the United States published by J. M.
Conna of Connecticut in the year of 1876. See the history of Freemasonry
among Colored Men in the United States by W. H. Grimshaw of Washington
D. C. 1903. These and many other Grand Lodges make the same statement.</p>

<p>Now to show you that these ignoramuses and peddlers of Masonic falsehood
did not even know or have the slightest conception of what they were
talking about. They hastened to put their ignorant and prejudice
imagination and conclusions into print which has been the cause and the
means of bringing confusion among the craft.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
The records of the War department of the English Government show that
General Gages Military Regiment was not in the United States of America
and located at Boston Mass. in the year of 1772-1773 and in the middle
part of the year of 1774. It appears from the record of the English War
department that General Gages Military Regiment which was stationed at
Boston Mass. was in the middle part of 1774 recalled to England and did
not return back to the United States again. And a number of
<a name="voluminous" id="voluminous"></a><ins title="Original has 'valuminous'">voluminous</ins> articles has on several <a name="occasions" id="occasions"></a><ins title="Original has 'occassion'">occasions</ins>
appeared in numerous American magazines by some of our American Military
Generals relative to the occupation of British soldiers on American soil
in the year of 1774, 1775, 1776 and you will find that they do not
mention or refer to the name of General Gages Military Regiment being
present in Boston Mass. in the year 1775 at Boston Mass. but they do
refer to <a name="General" id="General"></a><ins title="Original has 'Genaral'">General</ins> Gages Military Regiment being in the United
States at Boston in the year of 1772 and 1773 and the middle part of the
year of 1774 and having been recalled by the English government. In the
National Magazine of the month of June 1907 an article there appeared in
that magazine relative to the withdrawal by the English War Department
of General Gages Regiment from Massachusetts in the year of 1774.</p>

<p>And upon <a name="further" id="further"></a><ins title="Original has 'futher'">further</ins> investigation of this matter we find that
General Gages <a name="Military" id="Military"></a><ins title="Original has 'Millitary'">Military</ins> Regiment which Prince Hall, Boston
Smith, Thomas Sanderson and their associates claim to have been made
Master Masons on the 6th of March 1775 at Boston Mass. that General
Gages Regiment was not in the United States at that time. This was
published by a circular issued by James Barnett Grand Master of the
Grand Lodge of New York. See the proceedings of the organization of the
second Grand Lodge of Colored Masons Of the state of New York James
Barnett in the year of 1848. See the circular letter of Jacob Francis
Grand Secretary of the Grand Lodge of New York on
<a name="Oct" id="Oct"></a><ins title="Original has comma">Oct.</ins> 25th 1848,
and they state the same thing that General Gages Military Regiment was
not in the United States of America March the 6th 1775 and that being
true how can it be possible that Prince Hall, Boston Smith, Thomas
Sanderson and their associates could have been made Master Masons in a
Lodge in General Gages Military Regiment on the 6th of March 1775 at
Boston Mass. when General Gages Military Regiment was not in the United
States of America. It shows conclusively that the introduction of
Freemasonry in the State of Mass. among Colored Men was not only
unlawful and a fraud and sham, but that the statements coming from those
individuals from the State of Mass. was untruthful and unreliable and
they simply told beyond all peradventure of a doubt, a bare-faced,
wilful and malicious lie, and which had been manufactured for the very
purpose of misleading and hoodwinking the Colored People of this
country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
I am satisfied that the claim put forth by the members of the spurious
Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Mass. that Prince Hall and his associates
claiming that they were made Master Masons in a Lodge in General Gages
Military Regiment on March the 6th 1775 at Boston Mass. is a falsehood
and a complete misrepresentation from beginning to end for there is not
a particle of genuine <a name="documentary" id="documentary"></a><ins title="Original has 'documentry'">documentary</ins> evidence that has ever
been presented to sustain or reply upon anything that the followers and
Members of the Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Mass. has ever said or
written.</p>

only one Lodge and the name of that Lodge was African Lodge No. 459 this

See the printed proceedings of the various sessions of the Grand Lodge

Colored Men by J. N. Conna of Connecticut together with the Published
statements of a number of other Grand Lodges and they all emphatically
state and agree in language that is not uncertain, that the first Grand
Lodge of Colored Masons organized in the State of Mass. was African
Grand Lodge of Modern Masons which was organized with only one Lodge and
that was on the 24th day of June 1791 at Boston Mass.</p>

<p>There cannot be any doubt by any Masonic scholar or student in this day
or time nor there can be any uncertainty in the manner by the officers
and members of any well regulated and lawful Grand Lodge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span> Freemasonry
in the whole world, but that the establishing of African Grand Lodge of
Modern Masons of Mass. on the 24th of June 1791 with only one Lodge but
that it is a clandestine spurious and irregular body for it has been
since the year of 1717 that well established Masonic law of Freemasonry
that it requires not less that three warranted Lodges to organize a
regular Grand Lodge. The Masonic authorities on that proposition both in
this country and Europe are uninformed and no Grand Lodge has ever been
recognized as being a legal Grand Lodge that has been organized with a
less number than three warranted lodges.</p>


<h3>The Name of the African Grand Lodge of Massachusetts was Changed to the
Name of the Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Mass. in 1808.</h3>

<p>After the Death of Prince Hall which occurred in the year of 1807, at
the session held in the year of 1808 the name of African Grand Lodge of
Modern Masons of Massachusetts was changed to the name of Prince Hall
Grand Lodge of Modern Masons of Mass.</p>

<p>Judging from the rapid and numerous changes of position as soon as a
cloud appeared among the so-called bogus Masons and an spurious Grand
Lodge of Mass. some of the Masonic writers and followers and members of
the bogus Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Mass. when they where exposed and
shown up and dislodged from one untenable position they have jumped from
one position to another. On the 24th of June 1791 they called themselves
Modern Masons, in 1847 they called themselves Compact Masons, in 1880
they styled themselves as Free and Accepted Masons. We may expect at any
time to hear of those Masonic imposters and shams of Mass, belonging to
that notorious self constituted Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Mass. giving
themselves another title and name at any time.</p>

<p>Illustrious Sir and Bro: Your letter reached me on yesterday and many
thanks. You will kindly remember me to all brethren in Chicago. I like
America better than I do this country, or the places that I have been in
since I left Chicago probably that is owing to the fact that having been
born and reared in Chicago I feel more at home. But the French people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
and particularly those that are members of Masonic fraternity, are very
pleasant and kind. I visited one Lodge last night and last week I
visited the consistory of the Ancient Accepted Scottish Rite. Before you
are admitted in any of the Masonic <a name="bodies" id="bodies"></a><ins title="Original has 'bodys'">bodies</ins>, here you are
required to stand a very rigid examination, you know about what that is.
There is no prejudice in this section of the country against man because
he may be of a dark complexion, in all of my travels the Masonic body of
which you are the head of in America among colored Masons is the only
one that is known and recognized in this part of the country where I
have been. We will go to London, England, next week. I will write you
when I get there.</p>

<p>Very Dear Brother&mdash;We arrived here last week and will remain here
probably for a month. Will you kindly see Bro. Geo. Standwood, the
Secretary of Chicago Lodge No. 5, and pay him my dues to the Lodge? We
will be in Chicago the latter part of February, 1908. I have much to
tell you when I get home. I visited the Masonic Lodges since I have been
here and was treated with the utmost courtesy. The diploma from my Lodge
and Consistory that you signed has been a great service and benefit to
me. I hear your name quite highly spoken of by the members of the
Masonic Fraternity this side of the Atlantic ocean. The Lodges and
Masons that you are connected with in America among colored Masons are
the only ones that are recognized over here.</p>

<h3>CAN ONE MASONIC LODGE ASSUME THE FUNCTION OF A GRAND LODGE?</h3>

<p>Some one might ask the question can only one lodge assume the functions
of a Grand Lodge? The answer to that must be emphatically No, and
whatever Lodge assumes the functions of a Grand Lodge then such Grand
Lodge is unlawful and irregular. See Mackey's Masonic Jurisprudence, see
Mitchell's Authority on Masonic Law, see Chase and Preston on Masonic
Law and they all agree that one Lodge cannot assume the function of a
Grand Lodge.</p>


<h3>BOGUS PRINCE HALL GRAND LODGE OF MASSACHUSETTS NEVER HAS BEEN HEALED.</h3>

<p>In order to place the matter before the Masonic fraternity some one
might inquire and ask the question that since the time that African
Grand Lodge of Modern Masons of Massachusetts was organized with only
one Lodge. On the 24th of June. 1791, which is now the Prince Hall Grand
Lodge of Massachusetts have they ever been healed and legally
Masonically set right? The answer to that is that they have not and only
a short time ago they admitted by saying that they had never been
healed, and Masonically set right, and that being true they were
established in an unlawful manner and are clandestine and irregular
Masons to this very day, and I challenge them to present any proof to
the contrary.</p>


<h3>CAN A SUBORDINATE LODGE GRANT A LICENSE OR CHARTER TO ORGANIZE ANOTHER
LODGE? THEY CANNOT.</h3>

<p>In order to justify the irregular and unlawful Masonic work that has
been done in the State of Massachusetts by the Colored men who belong to
the Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Massachusetts they attempt to justify
their actions by saying that it was legal and lawful for African Lodge
No. 459 to grant a license or charter to organize another Lodge and they
have published in a circular of two cases of that kind that occurred in
the year 1625. I have taken particular pains to thoroughly investigate
the cases that they referred to and no such actions of that kind was
ever done by any Masonic Lodge in the places that they referred to. All
the Masonic authorities, both in this country and Europe, have made it
plain how a Masonic Lodge could be organized and it must be done by the
authority of a Grand Lodge. No intelligent Mason and no genuine and
regular Mason, either Black or White, in the whole world, can find any
authority or precedent where one Subordinate Lodge can grant a charter
to another Subordinate Lodge.</p>

<p>The Grand Lodge of the District of Columbia that Bro. H. C. Scott is the
Grand Master of, over two years ago commenced a law suit against the old
Compact Grand Lodge in the District of Columbia to prohibit them from
using the word "ancient" the old Compact Grand Lodge in the District of
Columbia filed a cross bill and saying that they were the first Grand
Lodge in the District of Columbia to use the word "ancient" and Judge
Wright of the Equity Court in giving his opinion rules and held that the
old Compact Grand Lodge of the District of Columbia was entitled to use
the word "ancient" and enjoined the Grand Lodge of the District of
Columbia that Bro. H. C. Scott is the Grand Master of from using the
word "ancient" and Bro. Scott and his Grand Lodge has appealed the case
to the Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia where they can get
justice in the matter. The law suit is a local matter between the two
Grand Lodges In the District of Columbia which does not in the least or
in any manner whatever affect any other Grand Lodge in this country and
does not alter or affect the Masonic legal status of the Grand Lodge of
the District of Columbia that Bro. H. C. Scott is the Grand Master of
except using the word "ancient" of which I am satisfied that the higher
court will reverse the decision of Judge Wright in the matter.</p>

PRINCE HALL AND HIS ASSOCIATES MADE MASONS WITHOUT ANY CHARTER OR
AUTHORITY.</h3>

<p>According to the statements made and published by the Prince Hall Grand
Lodge of Massachusetts, that from March the 16th, 1775 to 1787, that
African Lodge had no charter of any kind, and still in the face of all
of that we find that Prince Hall, Boston Smith, Thomas Sanderson of
Massachusetts, conferred the degrees of Free Masonry upon certain men
without any charter or without any authority whatever and still they
wish to call themselves regular Masons.</p>


<h3>CLANDESTINE, SPURIOUS AND UNLAWFUL NATIONAL COMPACT GRAND LODGE OF
MASONS OF NORTH AMERICA THAT WAS ORGANIZED AT BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS, ON
THE 24th OF JUNE, 1847.</h3>

<p>For many years past a great deal has been said and written about the
establishing of the Irregular and Illegitimate National Compact Grand
Lodge of Masons that was organized without a shadow of Masonic power and
authority in 1847 at Boston, Massachusetts and of all of the absurd and
ridiculous ideas which have ever incorporated itself in the minds of any
man who is a Mason there seems nothing so utterly weak and imbecile as
the doctrine that is advocated by the followers and adherents of that
Clandestine National Compact Grand Lodge which was founded upon
everything that was irregular and clandestine and
<a name="predicated" id="predicated"></a><ins title="Original has 'predicted'">predicated</ins> upon fiction fables and falsehoods, these and
nothing else.</p>

<p>The numerous statements that have been made and are being made now by
the exponents of the National Compact Grand Lodge purporting to be
genuine and historical, are solely unreliable and cunning inventions of
their own devised for the purpose of misleading the people.</p>

<p>On the 24th of June, 1847, at Boston, Mass., John T. Hilton, Grand
Master, Henry Harris, William Bruce, of the Prince Hall Grand Lodge of
Massachusetts, and James Bird, John G. Bias, James Richmond, of the
African Grand Lodge of North America, with its headquarters at
Philadelphia, Pa., and the Hiram Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania,
represented by James Newman, John Anderson, Samuel Brackles, Phillip
Buckhammond and several others from the Hiram Grand Lodge of
Pennsylvania, and from the Boyer Grand Lodge of New York was William H.
Clark, Lewis Hayden, Alexander Elston, together with several others, met
in Boston, Mass., and organized the National Compact Grand Lodge of
North America. They elected John T. Hilton, of Boston, Mass., National
Grand Master, and William E. Ambush was elected National Grand
Secretary. This National Compact Grand Lodge of North America has done
nothing but breed <a name="dissension" id="dissension"></a><ins title="Original has 'dissention'">dissension</ins> among Colored Masons in the
United States.</p>

never will as long as intelligent men have their right senses about
them.</p>


<h3><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
THE GRAND LODGE OF ENGLAND HAS NEVER RECOGNIZED THE PRINCE HALL GRAND
LODGE OF MASSACHUSETTS.</h3>

<p>If it was true that the Grand Lodge of England granted a charter to
African Lodge No. 459 at Boston, Mass., on Sept. 29th, 1784, and this
same African Lodge organized the African Grand Lodge of Modern Masons of
Massachusetts on the 24th of June, 1791, which now is the Prince Hall
Grand Lodge of Massachusetts, what was the matter or cause and reason
that the Grand Lodge of England has failed and refused to recognize the
Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Massachusetts?</p>

<p>It must be self apparent to every intelligent Mason that it shows and
proves conclusively that the Grand Lodge of England never did grant a
Charter to African Lodge No. 459 at Boston, Mass., as the leaders of the
Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Massachusetts would try to have you believe.
Who in the world ever heard of a Grand Lodge granting a charter to a
Subordinate Lodge and then refusing to recognize the very Lodge that the
Grand Lodge granted them a charter? It is the most ridiculous and absurd
statement I ever beard of. It certainly shows that the Grand Lodge of
England never at all granted a charter to African Lodge No. 459. On the
29th of Sept., 1784, and the officers of the Grand Lodge of England say
that they did not and all the talk about a commission having been
granted to Prince Hall as a Provincial Grand Master in America by the
Grand Lodge of England stamps the whole thing from beginning to the end
as a manufactured statement, a fraud and a sham.</p>


<h3>TWO WHITE MASONIC GRAND LODGES IN ENGLAND, ONE ORGANIZED IN 926 AND THE
OTHER ORGANIZED IN 1739.</h3>

<p>The first Grand Lodge organized among the White Masons of England was
organized at the City of York, England, in the year of 926, and the
second White Grand Lodge of England was organized at London, England, in
the year of 1739. See Mackey's Encyclopedia of Masonry; see Mitchell's
History of Freemasonry; see the Voice of Freemasonry published in
Chicago in the month of June, 1867. The members that composed the second
White Grand Lodge of England when it was organized in 1739 was made up
of expelled Masons from the first Grand Lodge of England that was
organized in the year of 926, and the second <a name="irregular" id="irregular"></a><ins title="Original has 'irrigeular'">irregular</ins>
and unlawful Grand Lodge of England that was organized at London,
England, in the year of 1739 is the same Grand Lodge. R. Holt was Deputy
Grand Master, and William White was the Grand Secretary, and it was from
this second irregular and unlawful Grand Lodge of England that the
African Lodge No. 459 claims that they secured their charter from.</p>

<p>In all fairness if the Grand Lodge of England granted a charter to
African Lodge No. 459 at Boston, Mass., it being a clandestine Grand
Lodge, it would follow beyond all dispute that African Lodge No. 459 at
Boston, Mass., was unlawful and clandestine Lodge. Although the Grand
Lodge of England has said they did not grant any charter to African
Lodge at Boston, Mass.</p>


<h3>PRINCE HALL GRAND LODGE OF MASSACHUSETTS HAS NEVER PRESENTED OR SHOWED
THE CHARTER OF AFRICAN LODGE, TO ANY PERSON.</h3>

<p>For many years the members of the Masonic fraternity have asked to see
the charter of African Lodge No. 459. That Prince Hall Grand Lodge
members of Massachusetts say that they had in their possession, and when
committees after committees have called and asked for to see it they
have been denied the opportunity and that one time they said in Boston,
Mass., to the committee that the charter had been destroyed by fire, and
another time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span> they told the committee that they could not find the
charter. Don't you think and believe that if they had a charter for
African Lodge in Massachusetts that they would have that historical
Lodge on their roll in their printed proceedings? If you can find the
name of African Lodge in any of the Masonic printed proceedings of the
Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Massachusetts it is more than any body else
can find. See and read the printed Masonic proceedings of the Prince
Hall Grand Lodge of Massachusetts, and see if you can find the name of
African Lodge printed there?</p>

<p>Dear Sir and Brother&mdash;We have remained here in London, England, longer
than we intended to, and since writing to you I have made a visit to
Dublin, Ireland. A large number of people in Dublin, Ireland, are doing
fairly well, but from time to time there is a large number of people
there leaving and going to United States. The other day I went to the
Masonic headquarters here in London, England, to find out and
investigate for myself if the Grand Lodge of England recognized the
Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Massachusetts as I had always heard that our
Masonry in America among Colored people came from Grand Lodge of England
and the officials of the Grand Lodge of England who were very courteous
to me took the occasion to inform me that the Grand Lodge of England
does not recognize or affiliate with the Prince Hall Grand Lodge of
Massachusetts. How is that Bro. Jones, that some of the Colored Masons
keep saying in America that they got their charter from the Grand Lodge
of England, when the Grand Lodge of England says that they do not
recognize the Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Massachusetts, and it was at
Boston, Mass., that the Colored Masons in Massachusetts have stated that
they got a charter for a Lodge from the Grand Lodge of England?</p>

<p>I want nothing more to do with any of the members that belong to the
Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Massachusetts. Our Colored brethren in United
States should be informed about this matter.</p>

<h3>THIS IS WHAT MAKES THE PRINCE HALL GRAND LODGE OF MASSACHUSETTS SPURIOUS
AND CLANDESTINE.</h3>

<p>1&mdash;Prince Hall, Boston Smith, Thomas Sanderson and their associates of
Boston, Mass., could not have been made Master Masons in a Lodge in
General Gages Military Regiment on the 6th day of March, 1775, at
Boston, Mass., for General Gages Military Regiment was not in the United
States at that time.</p>

<p>2&mdash;Prince Hall of Boston, Mass., never was appointed provincial Grand
Master in the United States by the Grand Lodge of England.</p>

<p>3&mdash;The Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Massachusetts having connected itself
with the spurious National Compact Grand Lodge of North America in 1847
surrendered all of its rights if it had any as a Grand Lodge.</p>

<p>4&mdash;The White Masonic Grand Lodge of England that African Lodge No. 459
obtained a charter from was a clandestine and unlawful Grand Lodge of
Modern Masons in England.</p>

<p>5&mdash;The Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Massachusetts styles themselves as
Modern Masons and Modern Masons are those Masons who refused to follow
and adhere to the ancient laws, rules and regulations and the landmarks
of Freemasonry. Those Modern Masons are Masonic innovators.</p>

EXTRACTS FROM THE PROCEEDINGS AND SOME OF THE DECISIONS OF THE VARIOUS
MASONIC CONGRESSES AND NATIONAL MASONIC CONVENTION HELD AMONG THE
COLORED MASONS IN THE UNITED STATES SINCE AUGUST 11th, 1820.</h3>

<p class="right4 nb">Chicago, Ill., April 8, 1908.</p>
<p class="noi nt">To All Whom This May Concern, Greeting:</p>

<p>The management of the International Masonic Bureau of Information of the
world wishes to state that we have devoted much time and labor in
collecting this much needed information which gives the time and place
as well as the decisions and also a brief account of the proceedings of
the various general Masonic congresses and National Masonic Convention
that has been held among the Colored Masons in the United States of
America since June 11th, 1820.</p>


<h3>THE FIRST NATIONAL CONVENTION OF COLORED MASONS OF UNITED STATES HELD
JUNE 11th, 1820, AT PHILADELPHIA, PA.</h3>

<p>A resolution was adopted recommending to the Grand Lodges that it was
unlawful and un-Masonic for any subordinate Lodge or Grand Lodge to
meddle with the degrees of Royal Arch Masons.</p>

<p>The convention after some other Masonic discussions adjourned.</p>


<h3>SECOND NATIONAL CONVENTION OF COLORED MASONS IN THE UNITED STATES HELD
AT BOSTON, MASS., JUNE 24th, 1847.</h3>

<p>John T. Hilton, Wm, A. Bruce, Henry Harris of the Prince Hall Grand
Lodge of Massachusetts, James Richmond, James Bird, Samuel Van Brackle,
Phillip Buchanan, John Anderson, James Powell of Pennsylvania, and
Alexander Elston, Wm. H. Clark of New York issued a call for National
Masonic Convention to meet in Boston, Mass., June the 24th, 1847, and it
was agreed and they did organize the National Compact Grand Lodge of
North America. John T. Hilton of Boston, Mass., was elected M. W. N.
Grand Master Wm. E. Ambush was elected National Grand Secretary. This
National Grand Lodge of North America adopted a constitution claiming
and exercising power and authority over every Grand Lodge of Masons in
each state in the United States and Canada.</p>

<p>This National Compact Grand Lodge in violation of all Masonic law
proceeded to issue charters to Grand Lodges in the United States which
was a Masonic law and rule that they adopted that was unheard of among
Masons of any nationality in any country or any land. This National
Compact Grand Lodge sowed the seed of discord and dissension among
Colored Masons in this country whose record has covered one of the
blackest pages in Masonic history. This National Compact Grand Lodge
continued to meet and elect officers for some years thereafter placing
heavy assessments upon subordinate Lodges and Grand Lodges throughout
the country.</p>


<h3>THIRD NATIONAL CONVENTION OF COLORED MASONS HELD IN UNITED STATES WAS AT
NEW YORK CITY OCT. 12th, 1848.</h3>

<p>James Barnett, Jacob Gibbs and several others of New York State called a
National Masonic Convention to meet in New York City, Oct. 12, 1848.
James Barnett was elected president of the convention.</p>

<p>Arnold Hicks offered a series of resolutions which was adopted bitterly
denouncing the National Compact Grand Lodge of North America that was
organized at Boston, Mass., June 24th, 1847. He claimed that the whole
National Compact Grand Lodge was a fraudulent and unlawful organization.</p>

<p>Chas. Hooten offered a resolution which was adopted that the
organization<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span> of African Grand Lodge of Modern Masons of Massachusetts,
June the 24th, 1791, at Boston, Mass., with only one Lodge that such
Grand Lodge was irregular and unlawful.</p>

<p>The Grand Lodge representative system was discussed and properly
outlined in the convention and each Grand Lodge was requested to follow
the same by an exchange of Grand representatives with each Grand Lodge.</p>

<p>A resolution was also adopted and the convention decided that the
Masonic law watch had been strictly adhered to by all regular Masons
that whenever a Grand Lodge for a State was organized that it required
not less than three warranted Lodges to assemble in a Masonic convention
for that purpose.</p>


<h3>FOURTH NATIONAL CONVENTION OF COLORED MASONS OF UNITED STATES WAS HELD
AT LEAVENWORTH, KANSAS, JULY 10th, 1869.</h3>

<p>Frank Caldwell offered a resolution to the effect which was adopted that
it is the sense of this convention that the establishing of Freemasonry
among Colored Masons in the United States at Boston, Mass., was
unauthorized and irregular and that the pretending of the organization
of African Grand Lodge of Modern Masons of Boston, Mass., June the 24th,
1791, was unwarranted and clandestine.</p>


<h3>THE FIFTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF COLORED MASONS OF UNITED STATES WHICH
CONVENED IN CHICAGO, AUGUST 10th, 1872.</h3>

<p>A resolution was offered by W. R. Lawton and adopted that a committee of
five (5) be appointed by the president of this congress to investigate
the correct origin and genuineness of Freemasonry among the Colored
Masons in the United States at Boston, Mass.</p>

<p class="noi">To the President and Members of the General Masonic Congress:</p>

<p>The undersigned committee that was appointed to investigate the origin
and the legal conditions of Freemasonry among our race in the State of
Massachusetts now submit their report. Your committee wishes to be
understood that we have taken considerable time in a thorough
examination of the matter and we have searched diligently to ascertain
the truth regardless of whom it may please or displease.</p>

<p>1&mdash;We find that the establishing of the African Grand Lodge of Modern
Masons in Massachusetts among the Colored men on June the 24th, 1791, at
Boston, Mass., that the whole work was irregular, unlawful and contrary
to Masonic law.</p>

<p>The names of the Grand officers that were elected at the organization of
this spurious and irregular African Grand Lodge of Modern Masons of
Massachusetts on June 24th, 1791, was as follows:</p>

<p>Prince Hall Grand Master, Nero Prince, Deputy Grand Master, Cyrus
Forbes, Grand Secretary, Peter Best, Grand Treasurer.</p>

<p>2&mdash;Your committee have investigated and made searching inquiry to find
who took part in the organization of the African Grand Lodge of Modern
Masons among the colored Masons at Boston, Mass., on June the 24th,
1791, and it appears from the records as well as the delegates from
Massachusetts who admit and confirm the same that there was only one
Lodge and that was African Lodge No. 459 that participated in the
organization of the African Grand Lodge of Modern Masons that was
organized June 24th, 1791, at Boston, Mass., such organization of the
Grand Lodge is in open violation of Masonic laws and we cannot indorse
or approve the same.</p>

<p>Your committee finds according to the statements of the delegates from
Massachusetts that since the time of the organization of the African
Grand Lodge of Modern Masons in the State of Massachusetts which
occurred June<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span> 24th, 1791, that no steps or effort had been made or
taken by the officers and members of the African Grand Lodge of Modern
Masons of Massachusetts to have said Grand Lodge Masonically legalized
and set right.</p>

<p>Your committee is wholly unable to find or secure any genuine
information that even a charter was ever granted by the Grand Lodge of
England for the establishing of African Lodge No. 459 at Boston, Mass.</p>

<p>Your committee has investigated various printed proceedings of the
African Grand Lodge of Massachusetts which name was changed in the year
of 1808 to the name of the Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Massachusetts, and
we cannot find the name of African Lodge No. 459 printed in any of the
Grand Lodge proceedings of Massachusetts.</p>

<p>Your committee is unable to find or be placed in the possession of any
genuine information that would lead the committee to believe that there
was ever a charter granted by the Grand Lodge of England to Prince Hall
and his associates at Boston, Mass.</p>

<p>Your committee finds further that the so-often repeated statement made
by some of the less informed brothers of our race that the color line
and prejudice had been the cause in the State of Massachusetts and other
places throughout the country and especially in the northern states in
the refusal of some of the White Grand Lodges of Masons in denying us
recognition was not based on account of color but it was predicated
solely upon the grounds that the origin of Freemasonry among the Colored
Masons in the State of Massachusetts was unlawful and irregular.</p>

<h3>THE SIXTH NATIONAL GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF COLORED MASONS OF THE UNITED
<a name="STATES" id="STATES"></a><ins title="Original has 'STATS'">STATES</ins> WAS HELD AT OMAHA, NEB., MAY THE 10th, 1874</h3>

<p>The Sixth National General Assembly of Colored Masons of the United
States convened at Omaha, Neb., May the 10th., 1874. Delegates were
present from the States of Pennsylvania, Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois,
Michigan, Tennessee, Missouri, Colorado, New York and Kansas. John G.

<h3>THE MOTHER OF ALL THE COMPACT AND STATE RITES IN THE UNITED STATES.</h3>

<p class="hang">Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Massachusetts Colored Masons, Spurious
Followers in New York State Come to Grief.</p>

<p>A case has been decided in the law court at Charlotte, New York State
that has created intense interest in the Masonic circles among Colored
Masons in several of the States last week, and the Colored Grand Lodge
of New York, which was first started some years ago by the Prince Hall
Grand Lodge of Massachusetts, met an overwhelming defeat and was routed
at every point. The Grand Lodge of the State of New York commenced a law
suit at Charlotte, N. Y., against several Masons representing the Hiram
Grand Lodge of Ancient Free and Accepted Masons of the State of
Pennsylvania to prevent them from organizing lodges in the State of New
York under the authority of the Hiram Grand Lodge of the State of
<a name="Pennsylvania" id="Pennsylvania"></a><ins title="Original has 'Pennsylvaniia'">Pennsylvania</ins>. The case came up before Judge Laverty
and was bitterly contested, and after an argument of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span> whole day by
counsel representing both sides Judge Laverty rendered his decision that
after investigating the matter thoroughly that the Prince Hall Grand
Lodge of Massachusetts that was organized many years ago, was an illegal
and irregular Grand Body, and that the Grand Lodge in the State or New
York having had lodges established in New York State that organized
lodges from the Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Massachusetts that
established the Grand Lodge of New York that it was an unlawful Grand
Lodge, and that the Hiram Grand Lodge of Colored Masons of the State of
Pennsylvania was a lawful and regular Grand Body. The Hiram Grand Lodge
of Pennsylvania was organized formerly of chartered lodges from the
Grand Lodge of the District of Columbia.</p>

<p>And the M. W. Grand Lodge A. F. and A. M. of the District of Columbia,
held her warrant of constitution, power and authority from the White
Grand Lodge Ancient Free and Accepted Masons of the Republic of Romania,
Germany.</p>

<p>This warrant was granted to Hon. H. C. Scott 33 degree G. M. in 1895, he
was the first and only Colored man in the United States of America to
ever receive a lawful and regular warrant from any White Grand Lodge of
Masons of foreign jurisdiction, and is now healing and setting
Masonically right the Colored Masons in the United States of America.</p>

<p>What have the so-called State Rites got to say about this verdict,
coming from the mouth of such an able jurist of the Empire State. Our
people have been and are being robbed out of thousands of dollars by
these bogus Masons in this and other States.</p>

<p>Done at Masonic headquarters this first day of December, 1908. San
Antonio, Texas.</p>

<p>Ninth Question&mdash;What is meant by the word and title of A. F. &amp; A. Y.
Masons?</p>

<p>Ninth Answer&mdash;A. F. &amp; A. Y. Masons means Ancient, Free and Accepted York
Masons, the city of York is in the north part of England, it is
celebrated for its traditional connection with Freemasonry in England.
The first charter granted in England to the Masons as a body was by
authority and power of King Athelstan, in the year of 926 at York,
England, and the application was made by Prince Edwin and Prince Edwin
summoned all the Masons in England to meet him in congregation at the
City of York, England, and from this assemblage of Masons at York the
letter "Y" originated. Prince Edward was elected Grand Master of the
Grand Lodge that was organized at York, England, in 926. From the
commencement of 926 of the assembly of Masons at York the letter "Y"
commenced, and has been known among members of the Masonic fraternity
and at the establishing of the Grand Lodge at York, England, in the year
926 they adopted a constitution and general regulation for the craft.</p>

<p>Prince Edwin, the brother of King Athelstan of England was an eminent
and distinguished Mason and King Athelstan was the grandson of King
Alfred the first <a name="anointed2" id="anointed2"></a><ins title="Original has 'annointed'">anointed</ins> King of England who translated
the Holy Bible into the Saxon language.</p>

<p>The Grand Lodge that was established in York, England, in 926 prospered
and flourished. The City of York, England, was the seat of Masonic
government of the craft in England.</p>


<h3>FREEMASONRY FIRST ORGANIZED IN THE STATE OF TEXAS ON APRIL THE 10th,
1873, AT AUSTIN, TEXAS.</h3>

<p>Tenth Question&mdash;When was Freemasonry first established in the State of
Texas among Colored men? As there have been a great deal of controversy
about the matter, inasmuch as some person have fixed it one place and
some have fixed it another place, let us see who is right?</p>

<p>Tenth Answer&mdash;The first Lodge of Colored Masons organized in the State
of Texas was at Austin, Texas, April 10th, 1873, the name of the Lodge
was Mount Bonnell Lodge, it was instituted and chartered by the
notorious self-constituted clandestine King Solomon Grand Lodge of the
State of Kansas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span> that Wm. D. Mathews was the Grand Master of, and all
Masonic students and all Masonic authors in the United States have said
time after time that the King Solomon Grand Lodge of Kansas was a bogus
Grand Lodge. Sometime after Mount <a name="Bonnell1" id="Bonnell1"></a><ins title="Original has 'Bonnel'">Bonnell</ins> Lodge was
organized at Austin, Texas. A Lodge was organized at San Antonio, Texas,
and Houston, Texas, and Galveston, Texas, all these Lodges were
established by the spurious King Solomon Grand Lodge of Kansas. And it
appears from the records and a circular issued by the King Solomon Grand
Lodge of Kansas that at the time the convention was held to organize a
Grand Lodge for the State of Texas that the Lodge at San Antonio, Texas,
and the lodge at Houston Texas, was only working under a dispensation
from the Grand Lodge of Kansas, and only a few years ago I held a
conversation myself with Wm. D. Mathews, Grand Master of the King
Solomon Grand Lodge of Kansas and he stated to me that at the time the
Grand Lodge of Texas was organized that there was only one Lodge and
that was <a name="Mount" id="Mount"></a><ins title="Original has 'Mounte'">Mount</ins> Bonnell Lodge at Austin, Texas, that was in
good Masonic standing and that Saint John's Lodge at Galveston, Texas,
and the Lodge at San Antonio, Texas, and the Lodge at Houston, Texas had
been suspended by the Grand Lodge of Kansas for un-Masonic conduct and
that the dispensation to three of these Lodges had been revoked by him
as Grand Master of the King Solomon Grand Lodge of State of Kansas and
in support of that the King Solomon Grand Lodge of Kansas refused to
recognize and hold any Masonic intercourse or affiliation with the Grand
Lodge of Texas. That matter came up and was discussed at the National
Masonic Convention held in the city of Chicago, Sept. 4th, 5th, 6th,
1877.</p>

<p>Eleventh Question&mdash;When was the Grand Lodge of Texas organized?</p>

<p>Eleventh Answer&mdash;A convention of delegates for the purpose of arranging
to organize a Grand Lodge of Texas was held at Brenham, Texas, Aug.
19th, 1874, and after some considerable discussion the convention
adjourned to meet at Houston, Texas, Jan. 19th, 1875, at Houston, Texas,
the so-called Grand Lodge of Texas was organized Jan. 19th, 1875, N. W.
<a name="Cuney1" id="Cuney1"></a><ins title="Original has 'Cuny'">Cuney</ins> was elected Grand Master and J. J. Hamilton was elected
Grand Secretary so it will be seen that Freemasonry in the State of
Texas was established in a clandestine manner by the compact King
Solomon Grand Lodge of Kansas.</p>

<p>Twelfth Question&mdash;Did the Grand Lodge of Texas work under the National
Compact Grand Lodge of North America and affiliate with it?</p>

<p>Twelfth Answer&mdash;It appears from the records that the so-called Grand
Lodge of the State of Texas took out a charter and worked under the
bogus National Compact Grand Lodge of North America and affiliated with
it and this same Grand Lodge of Texas now affiliates and recognizes such
bogus Grand Lodges as the Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Massachusetts, and
the notorious Compact Grand Lodge of Illinois whose records for
irregularity and spurious Masonic work have no equal in any part of the
world.</p>

<p>Thirteenth Question&mdash;Has the so-called Grand Lodge of Texas that J. W.
McKinney is the Grand Master of since <a name="it" id="it"></a><ins title="Original has 'its'">it</ins> was instituted in an
unlawful and irregular manner, has it ever been Masonically legalized by
any Grand Lodge of Masons in the whole world, if so let them state what
Grand Lodge it was, when it was, and where at, that question has been
propounded to them time after time and they have refused to answer it
and in as much as they have refused to answer it, it must be taken and
accepted as being unlawful and a bogus Grand Lodge let me have your
opinion about the matter?</p>

<p>Thirteenth Answer&mdash;I have called upon the leaders of the so-called Grand
Lodge of the State of Texas that is managed and controlled by J. W.
McKinney and his followers in the State of Texas to name the time and
place if they could, if their Grand Lodge was ever Masonically legalized
and set Masonically right by any legitimate Grand Lodge in the world.
And they have failed and refused to give the name, time or place when
the Masonic Grand Lodge of Texas was ever Masonically legalized by any
legitimate Grand Lodge in the country and they have failed to do that,
they are certainly designated as an unlawful and clandestine Compact
Grand Lodge. They were established in an irregular manner and are
unlawful and bogus from their inception down to the present day and the
most of the leaders of the Compact Grand Lodge in the State of Texas are
the largest falsifiers, and liars and Masonic innovators that have ever
held their hands up toward heaven and as for the truth, for any
statement that they might make I would just as soon believe one of them
over a spelling book as a Bible.</p>

KING SOLOMON GRAND LODGE OF KANSAS ORGANIZED JUNE 24th, 1867.</h3>

<p>Fourteenth Question&mdash;When was the King Solomon Grand Lodge of Kansas
that Wm. D. Mathews was Grand Master, when was it organized in the State
of Kansas, and whereat, and did this King Solomon Grand Lodge in Kansas
take out a charter and work under the National Compact Grand Lodge of
North America, give me all the facts and information that you have at
hand relative to that matter?</p>

<p>Fourteenth Answer&mdash;When the King Solomon Grand Lodge of Kansas was
organized June 24th, 1867, at Leavenworth, Kansas, it was accepted and
stated by most every Colored Mason in the United States that knew
anything about the matter that this King Solomon Grand Lodge of Kansas
was organized and proclaimed to be a Grand Lodge by Wm. D. Mathews and
his followers in the State of Kansas with only one Lodge and nobody
knows whether or not even that Lodge was a chartered Lodge. It was said
however that this one Masonic Lodge that proclaimed itself and organized
the King Solomon Grand Lodge of Kansas that it secured a charter from
the Compact Grand Lodge of the State of New York and at the time the
King Solomon Grand Lodge of Kansas was organized with only one
subordinate Lodge composed of a membership of eleven members. June 24th,
1867, at Leavenworth, Kansas, it took out a warrant of authority from
the National Compact Grand Lodge of North America that was organized in
the State of Massachusetts on the 24th day of June, 1847, for it must be
admitted by all well informed Masons that Massachusetts was the hotbed
and the Masonic factory where all kinds of Masonic degrees were
manufactured and all sorts and kinds of Masonic Lodges and Grand Lodges
and a spurious National Grand Lodge of North America was organized to
suit the time and conveniences of those that wished to secure and gain
high sounding Masonic titles regardless as to whether it was right or
wrong. If you have any doubt about the matter I herewith present a copy
of the warrant that was issued to the King Solomon Grand Lodge of Kansas
by that irregular and self-constituted National Compact Grand Lodge of
North America whose record has covered the very blackest page in Masonic
history among the colored Masons in this country.</p>

THE NATIONAL COMPACT GRAND LODGE OF NORTH AMERICA ORGANIZED AT BOSTON,
MASS., JUNE 24th, 1847.</h3>

<p>Fifteenth Question&mdash;In as much as there has been considerable discussion
and controversy going on through the country for a number of years,
relative to when the National Compact Grand Lodge of North America was
organized and where at, and whether or not it was considered irregular
and unlawful or whether it was a legitimate body, those questions have
been asked for a number of years.</p>

<p>Fifteenth Answer&mdash;Mackey's Masonic jurisprudence and all of the Masonic
authors on Masonic law have laid down the well established rule that has
been recognized in the United States of America ever since Freemasonry
was first established in this country, that there cannot be any higher
or Supreme power than a Grand Lodge of a state. And the spurious
National Compact Grand Lodge of North America is an unauthorized and
clandestine body. It was organized in Boston, Mass., on the 24th of
June, 1847, it has been a disgrace and a burning shame and a slander
upon the Colored Masons of this country ever since it was first
organized. The National Compact Grand Lodge of North America that was
established at Boston, Mass., on the 24th of June, 1847, is a self
constituted, <a name="bogus" id="bogus"></a><ins title="Original has 'bigus'">bogus</ins>, counterfeit grand body, and any Grand Lodge
or Subordinate Lodge in the United States of America that affiliates or
recognizes it is clandestine and bogus.</p>

<p>Sixteenth Question&mdash;When the Grand Lodge of Texas was organized at
Houston, Texas, Jan. 19th, 1875, that J. W. McKinney is now the Grand
Master of, did that Grand Lodge have a Charter from the Bogus National
Compact Grand Lodge of North America?</p>

<p>Sixteenth Answer&mdash;Yes they did, and looking over the records of the
National Grand Lodge of North America that was organized at Boston,
Mass., in 1847, which was a bogus concern. Here is a copy of the Charter
that was issued to the Grand Lodge of Texas in 1875 by the Spurious
National Compact Grand Lodge of North America.</p>

<p class="indent4">Richard Howell Cleaves, M. W. N. G. M.</p>

<p>Seventeenth Question&mdash;Did you ever have any correspondence with Wm. D.
Mathews, Grand Master of the Compact Grand Lodge of the State of Kansas
relative to the organization of the so-called Grand Lodge of the State
of Texas that was organized Jan. 19th, 1875?</p>

<p>Seventeenth Answer&mdash;Yes, I had some correspondence with Wm. D. Mathews,
Grand Master of the King Solomon Grand Lodge of the State of Kansas
relative to the subordinate Lodges that took part in the organization of
the Grand Lodge of Texas, Jan. 19th, 1875. That was the time that the
Grand Lodge of Texas was organized when N. W. Cuney of Galveston, Texas,
was elected Grand Master.</p>

<p class="noi nb">Mr. John G. Jones, 33,</p>
<p class="nt">Grand Secretary of the M. W. St. Johns Grand Lodge of Illinois,</p>

<p>Dear Sir and Bro&mdash;Your letter reached me last week at my home in
Leavenworth, Kan., and in giving you the information that you desire the
Lodge at Austin, Texas, was the first Lodge of Colored Masons organized
among the Colored men in the State of Texas, it was on April 10th, 1873,
it was chartered by the Most Worshipful King Solomon Grand Lodge of
Kansas of which I have the honor of being its Grand Master. That was the
only Lodge that was in good Masonic standing in our Grand Lodge when the
Grand Lodge of the State of Texas was organized. The Lodge at San
Antonio, Galveston, and Houston Texas was also chartered by our Grand
Lodge of Kansas, but none of these last named three Lodges was in good
and regular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span> standing in our Grand Lodge. So you will notice that the
Grand Lodge of Texas only had one warranted Lodge when it was
established.</p>

<p>Your committee that was appointed to investigate the origin of
Freemasonry in the State of Texas beg leave to make the following
report:</p>

<p>We have carefully investigated the matter of the origin of Freemasonry
in the State of Texas and we find that it appears from the record that
Freemasonry was first established in the State of Texas by Wm. D.
Mathews, Grand Master of the King Solomon Grand Lodge of Compact Masons
for the State of Kansas which at the time the said King Solomon Grand
Lodge of Kansas was under and subordinate to the National Compact Grand
Lodge of North America.</p>

<p>We further find that the said Grand Lodge of Texas that C. C. Dean is
the Grand Master of that, the said Grand Lodge of Texas, when organized
January 19th, 1875, did not follow and comply with the landmarks and
laws of Freemasonry and that the said Grand Lodge of Texas is an
unlawful and irregular Grand Lodge and that the delegates from the Grand
Lodge of the State of Texas to this National Masonic Convention are not
entitled to seats in this National Masonic Convention,</p>

<p class="center">FIRST REGULAR AND LEGAL GRAND LODGE OF COLORED MASONS IN UNITED STATES
AT WASHINGTON, D. C., 1895.</p>

<p>The first Grand Lodge of Colored Masons in the United States that was
healed and Masonically set right was the Grand Lodge of Colored Masons
of the District of Columbia which H. C. Scott is the Grand Master of. It
occurred in the year of 1895 by the duly accredited representatives from
the White Masonic Grand Lodge of Romania, Germany.</p>

<p>The Most Worshipful St. Johns Grand Lodge of A. F. &amp; A. M. Masons of the

Texas. A Masonic convention was held in the State of Texas by several of
the Subordinate Lodges in the State of Texas on March 19th, 1908, at San

<h3>DECISIONS OF MASONIC GRAND LODGES.</h3>

<p>1.&mdash;Since the Grand Lodge of the District of Columbia has been under the
supervision and control of the Past Grand Master Wm. H. Johnson and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span> the
present Grand Master H. C. Scott of Washington, D. C., the Grand Lodge
has rendered some very important decisions which has been a guide for
many of the Grand Lodges for sometime in the past and will be a guide
and a landmark for many of the Grand Lodges in the future.</p>

<p>The Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Massachusetts is Irregular and
clandestine, it was instituted with only one subordinate Lodge.</p>

<p>The Most Worshipful St. John's Grand Lodge of A. F. &amp; A. Masons of the
State of Illinois that Bro. John G. Jones is the Grand Master of was
lawfully and constitutionally established according to the landmarks and
laws of Freemasonry and is recognized by this <a name="Grand" id="Grand"></a><ins title="Original has 'grand'">Grand</ins> Lodge.</p>

<p>The Most Worshipful King Solomon Grand Lodge of A. F. &amp; A. Masons of the
State of Texas that Bro. Chas. L. Mitchell is Grand Master of has been
regularly and lawfully established and is recognized by this Grand
Lodge.</p>

<p>The Most Worshipful St. Andrew's Grand Lodge of A. F. &amp; A. Mason of the
State of Louisiana that Wm. T. Grant is the Grand Master of has been
regularly instituted according to the landmarks and laws of Freemasonry
and is recognized by this Grand Lodge.</p>

<p>The Most Worshipful German Grand Lodge of A. F. &amp; A. Masons of the State
of Alabama that Bro. J. H. McGehee is the Grand Master of has been
lawfully instituted and is recognized by this Grand Lodge.</p>

<p>The Most Worshipful Wm. T. Grant, Jr., Grand Lodge of A. F. &amp; A. Masons
of the State of Mississippi has been regularly organized and is
recognized by this Grand Lodge. Bro. J. R. Rawlins of Natchez, Miss., is
the Grand Master of.</p>

<p>The Most Worshipful Hiram Grand Lodge of A. F. A. Masons of the State of
Pennsylvania that Bro. C. R. France is the Grand Master of, has been
instituted in a regular and lawful manner and is recognized by this
Grand Lodge.</p>

<p>The Most Worshipful Grand Lodge of the State of Florida that Bro. E. E.
Franklin is the Grand Master of was regularly instituted and is
recognized by us.</p>

<p>We find the formation of the spurious Grand Lodge of Texas that J. W.
McKinney is the Grand Master of and W. M. McDonald is the Grand
Secretary of, was established in the most extraordinary irregular and
unlawful manner and is with the establishing of the bogus Prince Hall
Grand Lodge of Massachusetts which was only organized with one Lodge.</p>

<p>The so-called Grand Lodge in the State of Texas which is said to have
been instituted by K. R. Rogers of Austin, Texas, and is known as the
Hiram Tyram Grand Lodge is beyond all question or doubt the most
Clandestine and irregular Masonic Grand Lodge that has ever appeared
upon the Masonic stage of action. It is a Grand Lodge only on paper and
was instituted not in compliance with any of the landmarks or laws of
Freemasonry and is therefore counterfeit and Bogus and is not recognized
by this Grand Lodge.</p>

<p>This Grand Lodge has carefully examined into the origin of the Compact
Grand Lodge of Masons in the State of Illinois that H. E. Burris, of
Rock Island is the Grand Master, and the notorious R. E. Moore is the
Grand Secretary of, and we find it was instituted with only two
warranted Lodges and a Lodge under dispensation and from the records of
the Grand Lodge of Ohio one of the warranted Lodges that took part in
the convention was at that time not in good standing with the Grand
Lodge of Ohio. See records of the Grand Lodge of Ohio of 1865 and 1866.</p>

<p>Prince Hall of Massachusetts, a founder of a Spurious and Illegitimate
Masonry, among the Colored Masons in the United States, died at Boston,
Mass., in the year of 1807.</p>


<h3>COLORED GRAND LODGE OF ALABAMA.</h3>

<p>The Colored Masonic Grand Lodge of the State of Alabama which is named
the German Grand Lodge of A. F. &amp; A. Masons of the State of Alabama in
the year of 1906 at the annual session held at Montgomery, Ala., Bro.
J.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span> H. McGehee, 33, Grand Master, and Bro. G. W. Hill, 32, Grand
Secretary, the Grand Lodge made the following decisions:</p>

<p>That the Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Massachusetts was organized with
only one Lodge which makes the Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Massachusetts
unlawful clandestine and irregular Grand Lodge.</p>

<p>It requires not less than three warranted Lodges to assemble in a
Masonic convention and organize a regular Grand Lodge for a State.</p>

<p>All Masons who are members of Compact Lodges are Bogus, Irregular and
Clandestine, and must not be recognized as Masons anywhere.</p>

<p>No compact Mason can be admitted in any subordinate Lodge in this State.</p>

<h3>DECISIONS OF WHITE MASONIC GRAND LODGES. GRAND LODGE OF ARKANSAS.</h3>

<p>The White Masonic Grand Lodge of the State of Arkansas at the annual
session held in 1838 and 1838 rendered the following decision:</p>

<p>This Grand Lodge will not recognize a Grand Lodge unless it has been
regularly organized by not less than three warranted Lodges.</p>

<h3>GRAND LODGE OF CONNECTICUT.</h3>

<p>The White Grand Lodge of Connecticut was organized July 8th, 1789, the
following is some of the decisions that the Grand Lodge of Connecticut
has rendered:</p>

<p>One Grand Lodge cannot issue a charter to organize another Grand Lodge.</p>

<p>The power and the authority to organize a Grand Lodge resides in the
three warranted Lodges that meet in a Masonic convention for that
purpose.</p>

<p>A regular Grand Lodge of Masons of a state is vested with power and
authority to go in another state and there organize subordinate Lodges
if the Grand Lodge in that state which has been already organized was
organized In an unlawful and irregular manner.</p>

<p>When a Grand Lodge of a state has been organized in an unlawful Masonic
way and manner it is then considered as no Grand Lodge at all and
another lawful and regular Grand Lodge has the authority and power to
invade such territories and there organize regular subordinate Lodges.</p>

<p>The White Masonic Grand Lodge of Alabama in the year of 1821 rendered
the following decisions at the session held at Montgomery, Alabama,
Thomas W. Farrar was Grand Master and Thomas A. Rogers was Grand
Secretary.</p>

<p>A Grand Lodge of a State cannot be regularly organized unless there is
not less than three regularly warranted Lodges.</p>

<h3>WHITE MASONIC GRAND LODGE OF DELAWARE.</h3>

<p>The Masonic Lodge of the State of Delaware since it was organized on
June the 6th, 1806, has rendered some very important decisions which has
been a guide for many of the Grand Lodges that have been organized since
that time.</p>

<p>The African Grand Lodge of Colored Masons in the State of Massachusetts
cannot be recognized not because they are Colored Masons but for the
reason that they were unlawfully instituted. They organized a Grand
Lodge with only one Lodge when they should have had not less than
three.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
A regular Grand Lodge must be organized with not less than three
warranted Lodges.</p>


<h3>THE LIGHT TURNED ON, ON BOGUS MASONRY IN TEXAS.</h3>

<p>The record shows the first Lodges In Texas were organized by Capt. W. D.
Matthews, Grand Master of the King Solomon Compact Grand Lodge of
Kansas, on April 10, 1873, by organizing Mt. <a name="Bonnell2" id="Bonnell2"></a><ins title="Original has 'Bonnel'">Bonnell</ins> Lodge
No. 1, Austin, No. 2, San Antonio and No. 3 Houston, No. 4 at Galveston.
On the 19th of August, 1875, these four lodges met at Brenham, Texas,
and organized a Compact Grand Lodge with N. W. <a name="Cuney3" id="Cuney3"></a><ins title="Original has 'Cuny'">Cuney</ins> as the
Grand Master, and J. J. Hamilton as Grand Secretary.</p>

<p>Some years after, about 1885, (the record is not clear,) C. C. Dean
succeeded N. W. <a name="Cuney4" id="Cuney4"></a><ins title="Original has 'Cuny'">Cuney</ins> as Grand Master. Rev. A. Grant, W. D. G.
M., and in the year 1886 C. C. Dean, G. M.</p>

<p>Rev. A. Grant, W. D. G. M., called a special session of the Grand Lodge
and at that session declared and adopted the act of Secession from the
National Compact Grand Lodge, elected delegates to go to Houston, Texas,
as special commissioners to meet the Worshipful Grand Lodge of White
Masons for the purpose of being healed and chartered.</p>

<p>Now, according to the record found in Sayles' Masonic Jurisprudence, on
the History of Negro Masonry in Texas, emphatically states that these
Negro delegates did appear and did present to the White Grand Lodge a
petition to be healed and chartered.</p>

<p>Sayles does not give the names of the petitioners. The petition sets
forth that there were 650 members at that time, to be healed.</p>

<p>The record shows that the White Grand Lodge appointed a committee to
investigate the petition, and the record further shows that the
committee made the following report:</p>

<h4>COMMITTEE REPORT ON NEGRO MASONRY IN TEXAS.</h4>

<p>"We your committee find that these 650 so-called Negro Masons are not
Masons, and have no business with us nor about us, neither of us. If
Ephriam is joined to his Idols let him alone."</p>

<p>Now the record further shows that this Grand Lodge has sent delegates to
the General Masonic Congress on several occasions, and these delegates
were rejected. The first was in Sept. 4th and 5th, 1887, at Chicago. Mr.
Gillett of Kansas, offered the following resolution and it was
unanimously adopted:</p>

<p>"Whereas, The facts are before this convention that the Grand Lodge of
Texas, Colored, under C. C. Dean as Grand Master, was organized by
subordinate lodges instituted in the State of Texas by W. D. Matthews,
Grand Master of the Compact Grand Lodge of Kansas.</p>

<p>"Be it Resolved by this convention that the said Grand Lodge of Texas,
above mentioned, is hereby now declared by this convention to be an
unlawful and irregular Grand Lodge, and that this National Masonic
convention will now refuse and neither recognize or admit their
delegates in this convention."</p>

<p>And similar resolutions were adopted at the General Masonic Congress
that was held in <a name="Pittsburgh" id="Pittsburgh"></a><ins title="Original has 'Pittsburg'">Pittsburgh</ins>, Pa., July, 1904.</p>


<h3>HOW THE MOST WORSHIPFUL KING SOLOMON GRAND LODGE, A. F. &amp; A. M. WAS
ORGANIZED IN THE STATE OF TEXAS.</h3>

<p>The origination of the M. W. King Solomon Grand Lodge, A. F. &amp; A. Masons
which was organized March 19, A. D., 1908, and incorporated under the
laws of the State of Texas, March 27, A. D., 1908, of the following
Lodges, viz:</p>

<p>Mount Nebo Lodge No. 14, Galveston, Tex., Brackenridge Lodge No. 21,
Excelsior Lodge No. 25, San Antonio, Golden Jewel Lodge No. 23, Taylor;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Eureka Lodge No. 12, Hempstead.</p>

<p>These (5) five Lodges held their warrant of constitution from the M. W.
St. John Grand Lodge, A. F. &amp; A. M. of the State of Illinois of which
the Hon. John G. Jones, 33rd degree, is Grand Master, and the M. W. St.
John Grand Lodge, A. F. &amp; A. M. held her warrant of constitution from
the M. W. Grand Lodge A. F. &amp; A. M., of Washington, District of
Columbia, of which Hon. H. C. Scott, 33rd degree is Grand Master. This
warrant was granted to Hon. H. C. Scott, 33rd degree Grand Master in the
year 1895. He was the first and only Colored Mason in the United States
of America to ever receive a lawful and regular warrant from any White
Grand Lodge of Masons of foreign jurisdiction, and he is now healing and
setting Masonically right the Colored Masons in the United States of
America.</p>

<p>According to Masonic law the only lawful and regular Grand Lodge of
Colored Masons in the State of Texas is the Most Worshipful King Solomon
Grand Lodge, A. F. &amp; A. M., which was organized at San Antonio, Texas,
on 19th day of March, A. D., 1908 and lawfully incorporated under the
laws of the State of Texas on the 27th day of March, A. D., 1908, and it
is the only Colored Grand Lodge A. F. &amp; A. M. in the State of Texas that
is recognized by foreign White Masonic jurisdiction of which C. L.
Mitchell, 33rd degree is Grand Master.</p>

<p>Montgomery, Ala., April 11, 1908&mdash;King Solomon Grand Lodge of the Lone
Star State (Texas) has been legally organized, 19th day of March, 1908,
at San Antonio, Texas. Ill. C. L. Mitchell, 33, Grand Master, 310
Monterey <a name="Street" id="Street"></a><ins title="Original has 'street'">Street</ins>, San Antonio; Ill. J. F. VanDuzor, Grand
Secretary; K. R. Rogers, 33d, of Austin, was expelled. Mount Calvary
Grand Commandery Knights Templars and Keystone Grand Chapter of Royal
Arch Masons, were organized by Ill. John G. Jones, 33d, G. G. C. of
Chicago. All of this grand work was done on March 19th and 20th, 1908.
Ill. John G. Jones is destined to capture the United States. Ill. C. L.
Mitchell, 33d, will lead Texas against all opposition and perfidy.
Hurrah for the Texas invincible. The German Grand Lodge of Alabama, A.
F. and A. Masons, extend them the right hand of fellowship. We will
gladly accept a fraternal representative from that jurisdiction, as this
is the only Legal Grand Masonic Lodge organized in Texas.</p>

<p>Montgomery, Ala., June 20, 1908&mdash;The Grand Lodge over which Mr. J. W.
McKinney, of Texas, presides is spurious and bogus, and belongs to the
original Prince Hall Clandestine National Compact Grand Lodge of Masons
of Boston, Mass. He has no Masonic authority in the world for operating
Masonry in the State of Texas. Ill. C. L. Mitchell, 33d, is the only
legal Grand Master of A. F. &amp; A. M. in Texas, and all intelligent
gentlemen like Dr. Sparks, of Terrell, Tex., and others will allow Ill.
Mitchell, of San Antonio, Texas, to heal and Masonically set them right.</p>


<h3>EXTRACT FROM THE HISTORY OF BOGUS MASONRY AMONG COLORED MEN IN MISSOURI.</h3>

<p>Seventh Question&mdash;Are you acquainted with Brother Chas. L. Mitchell, 33

<p>Seventh Answer&mdash;Yes. I am well acquainted with him. Bro. Chas. L.
Mitchell is a Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Texas and is a
prominent and distinguished Mason, and a very reliable and honest man.
He is a man and Mason that stands high in the estimation of the people
all over the country. He has the power and authority to organize Masonic
Lodges in the State of Missouri, and all Masonic work done by him is
regular and genuine, for there is not now a lawful and genuine Masonic
Lodge, nor Grand Lodge in the State of Missouri, except the Lodges that
Bro. Chas. L. Mitchell, 33d degree has organized.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
